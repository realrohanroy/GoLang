# Day 6 - Learning Journal

## Go Language (Main Focus - 80-90%)
1. **Struct Basics**
   - Defined and created structs in Go.
   - Understood structs as blueprints for custom types.
   - Learned how to create and initialize struct instances.

2. **Methods in Go**
   - Reinforced how to bind functions to structs (methods).
   - Learned the difference between value receivers and pointer receivers.
   - Practiced writing methods like `area()` for rectangles.

3. **Struct Composition**
   - Learned how structs can include other structs (like inheritance in OOP).
   - Example: `Car` struct embedding `Engine` struct.
   - Composition is preferred in Go over inheritance.

4. **Exercises & Reinforcement**
   - Created different structs (`Person`, `Car`, `Rectangle`).
   - Added methods to structs to practice real-world use cases.
   - Discussed relation between creating new struct instances and object creation.

## Side Study (10-20%)
**Topic: Software Engineering Principles (for Cloud-Native Developer role)**
- Started exploring **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.
- Focused on **Requirement Analysis** (Step 1 of SDLC).
   - Importance of understanding "what problem to solve".
   - How to write clear, unambiguous requirements.
   - Requirement gathering from stakeholders (use cases, user stories).
   - Example: Designing requirements for a Parking App.

## Reflection
- Learned a lot of new concepts today: structs, methods, composition.
- Important reinforcement: **Composition > Inheritance in Go**.
- Revision helped cement methods and struct basics.
- Side study gave insights into **requirements gathering** which is crucial for being a strong cloud-native engineer.
